    <h1>Chocolate Peanut Butter Protein Mousse</h1>
        <img src="../img/proteinmousse1.jpeg" alt="mousse">
    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
        <p>Getting enough protein on a daily basis is no easy feat. 
            This 4-ingredient mousse, though, will change the way you 
            reach your protein goals. Between its light, airy texture
            and its nutrient-dense make up, this decadent snack will
            make your nutrition goals all the more achievable (and delecious!).</p>

            <p>Easily paired with fruit, granola, chocolate chips, nuts, 
                graham crackers, or some combination of all of the above, this 
                mixture is easy to make, stores beautifully, and only takes a
                few minutes to come together. If you have chocolate protein
                powder, peanut butter, avocadoes, and greek yogurt just 
                <em>begging</em> to be used, this recipe is for you.</p>
