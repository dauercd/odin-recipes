            <li>1 tortilla</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh spinach, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped protein of choice (sausage, bacon bits, etc.)</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>combine chopped spinach, eggs, and choice of chopped
                 protein in a bowl with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>heat greased pan on stove over medium heat</li>
            <li>let egg mixture cook untouched for about 30 seconds, then 
                lift edges carefully while rotating pan to allow wet egg on 
                top to fall to the bottom of the pan to cook evenly</li>
            <li>when only a bit of wet egg is left, sprinkle 1/2 cup of cheese on top 
                and place tortilla on top to cover for about 30 seconds, sealing the edges
                with the little bit of cheese and egg mixture left</li>
            <li>flip tortilla and egg so that the tortilla side is down
                and set to low heat</li>
            <li>sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top and let settle for 30
                more seconds</li>
            <li>fold sides of flat burrito in toward the middle and flip face down to seal</li>
            <li>serve with your favorite sauces, salsa, guacamole, and more</li>
